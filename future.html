<p>According to the salary sheet from before, AI engineer in San Francisco makes $128,077 per year with 2 years experience, which would be the amount of time I would habe been working assumming no problems. Which according to the calculator(if I'm doing it right) if I am paid per period monthly I would have a net pay of $64,442.03 or $5370 per month. Assuming that $5370 is my last pay before the 3 months I would use it like this(now includes service provider)
<ul class="list">
    <li>Month 1 - Basic needs: $200.30 - Remaining: 5169.70</li>
    <li>Month 2 - Basic needs: $307.30 - Remaning: 4862.40</li>
    <li>Month 3 - Basic needs: $289.73 - Remaning: 4572.67</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This is excluding things like utlilities or rent because I couldn't figure out how to do it. My entertainment would be entirely covered if I had internet so I would be fine there too.
